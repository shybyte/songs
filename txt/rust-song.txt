Long time ago I wrote nodejs code in javascript
but after some month it turned into a pile of shit
another bug at runtime
another function undefined

but then I met what will save us,
but then I met what gave me new trust

Because in Rust
we can trust
because in rust we trust

If your code turns at runtime into Dust
you might consider using Rust
